## Sign up page template

![Screenshot of sign up form](/screenshot.png "Sign up page screenshot")

A responsive two-step sign up form template. Form labels come in the form of questions to mimic a conversation  instead of the usual markers. I think it's nice to adopt a more human approach when it comes to asking users for information. Simple, need-to-know details only ie name and email.

Could've been less hassle to use jQuery but I wanted to go vanilla JS on this. 

Colors inspired by Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited.
